6. What is shared library in Linux.
------>In Linux, a shared library is a collection of pre-compiled, reusable code that can be shared among multiple programs.
 It is also referred to as a dynamic link library or a shared object.

When a program needs to use a function or a piece of code that is present in a shared library, it dynamically links to the library at runtime.
 This means that the code in the library is loaded into the memory and made available for the program to use. This dynamic linking allows
 multiple programs to share the same code, reducing the memory footprint and improving performance.

Shared libraries are commonly used in Linux for system libraries, such as those that handle graphics, input/output, or network operations.
 Applications can also make use of shared libraries to access common functions and utilities.

Shared libraries are typically stored in the /lib or /usr/lib directories in Linux. They have a filename extension of .so, which stands for shared object.
 The ldconfig command is used to update the shared library cache and make newly installed libraries available to the system.
